## Notes
With the exception of [Elementary Cellular Automaton](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) that I've implemented, all of the automata included in this repository are more art than automata. Think of them as data visualizations for random data.

## Applause
I got thinking about this automata during a presentation I recently attended at work. The top portion of the image represents a speech or presentation that was given. The vertical lines beneath the speech are individual people. The length of the vertical lines indicate how long each person would clap in response to what was said and each vertical person is influenced by the people around them. If a person's left and/or right neighbor is clapping, there's a chance the person in question will continue to clap because of social pressures.
